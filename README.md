AI-powered Sentiment Analysis Tool
This project is an AI-powered sentiment analysis tool designed to analyze and classify product reviews into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. Leveraging machine learning algorithms and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, this tool provides valuable insights from textual data, enabling users to understand the sentiment behind product reviews. Additionally, it offers the capability to compute an overall sentiment score for a product based on aggregated reviews.

Features
Sentiment Classification: The tool employs machine learning algorithms to classify product reviews into three categories: positive, negative, or neutral.
Training Capability: Users can train the system using labeled datasets of product reviews to improve classification accuracy.
NLP and Sentiment Analysis Libraries: Utilizes state-of-the-art NLP and sentiment analysis libraries to extract meaningful insights from text data.
Scalability and Extendability: Designed to be scalable and extensible, allowing for further enhancements and customization.
Overall Sentiment Score: Provides an aggregated sentiment score for a product, giving a holistic view of customer sentiment.
Examples
Positive
"Love this dress"
"This is one of those you have to try it on to appreciate the lovely unique design."
"A flattering, super cozy coat"
Neutral
"True to size on the neckline and arms but extremely large and puffy in the torso. very unflattering cut!"
"I bought this tank for work, but the color of the print is slightly muted compared to the photo."
"Usually wear a xxs or xs (i am 100 lbs, 5'1) and i got the xs thinking it will be loose, which I wanted. the arm holes were down to my waist, and it was also unusually wide. the quality of the fabric is nice though, not too heavy and not too thin."
Negative
"So disappointing!"
"There is no way this is worth the price. I was deeply disappointed when it arrived."
"Very cheap looking material. Looks cheap for the cost."
"I'm so incredibly disappointed. The dress is beautiful but the one I received is torn and has multiple strands of beads missing."
